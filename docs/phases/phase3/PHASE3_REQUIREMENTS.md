# Phase 3 - Requirements - Core Gameplay Systems

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 delivers the core gameplay systems that transform our authenticated, networked foundation into a fully functional MMORPG template. This phase implements inventory management, combat mechanics, chat functionality, NPC interactions, and a quest framework - the essential systems that define player engagement with the game world. These systems are designed to be highly customizable, allowing developers to create unique gameplay experiences while leveraging battle-tested architectural patterns.

## Product Vision

### Core Gameplay Systems Overview

Phase 3 provides production-ready implementations of five interconnected systems that form the heart of any MMORPG:

1. **Inventory Management** - Item storage, equipment, and resource management
2. **Combat System** - Target-based combat with server-authoritative damage calculation
3. **Chat System** - Real-time communication with multiple channels and commands
4. **NPC System** - Interactive non-player characters for shops, quests, and world building
5. **Quest Framework** - Flexible quest creation and progression tracking

### Design Philosophy

- **Extensibility First** - Every system designed with modification in mind
- **Server Authoritative** - Prevent cheating while maintaining responsive gameplay
- **Performance Optimized** - Handle hundreds of concurrent players per server
- **Developer Friendly** - Clear APIs, comprehensive examples, debugging tools
- **Content Agnostic** - Systems work with any art style or gameplay theme
