# Phase 1B - Frontend Authentication - Daily Progress Log

## Day 1: 2025-07-24

### Completed Today
1. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated PROJECT_STATUS.md to mark Phase 1B as started
   - Updated PHASE1_TRACKING.md to show Phase 1B in progress
   - Created comprehensive PHASE1B_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md

2. **C++ Authentication System**
   - Created FAuthTypes.h with all authentication data structures
   - Implemented UMMORPGAuthSubsystem for authentication logic
   - Created UMMORPGAuthSaveGame for token persistence
   - Integrated with existing networking subsystem

### Key Implementation Details
- **Auth Subsystem**: Full JWT token management with auto-refresh
- **Save Game**: Secure storage of refresh tokens for auto-login
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error propagation using FMMORPGError
- **Blueprint Support**: All functions exposed to Blueprint

### Next Steps for User
1. Compile the C++ code in Visual Studio
2. Create main menu game mode and player controller
3. Design login UI widget
4. Wire up authentication flow in Blueprint
5. Test with backend services

### Technical Notes
- Auth subsystem uses game instance subsystem pattern
- Tokens are automatically refreshed 1 minute before expiry
- Network subsystem handles auth headers automatically
- Save game only stores refresh token if "Remember Me" is enabled

### Issues Encountered
- **Circular Dependency Error**: Multiple attempts to fix
  1. First tried PrivateIncludePathModuleNames - didn't work
  2. Root cause: NetworkSubsystem->GetHTTPClient() method doesn't exist
  3. Final solution: Removed all MMORPGNetwork dependencies and temporarily disabled HTTP functionality
  4. TODO: NetworkSubsystem needs proper HTTP client implementation

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] C++ code compiles without errors
- [ ] Auth subsystem initializes properly
- [ ] Login endpoint connects to backend
- [ ] Tokens are saved/loaded correctly
- [ ] Auto-refresh works as expected

## Day 2: [Date TBD]

### Planned Tasks
- Create login/register UI widgets
- Test authentication flow
- Implement error handling UI
- Begin character system design

## Notes for Future Reference
- Backend auth service must be running on port 8081
- Gateway must be running on port 8080
- Use test credentials created during Phase 1A testing
- Check console output for debugging
