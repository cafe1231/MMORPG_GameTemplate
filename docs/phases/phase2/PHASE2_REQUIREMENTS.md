# Phase 2 - Requirements - Real-time Networking Foundation

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 establishes the real-time networking foundation that transforms our authenticated users from Phase 1 into connected players in a persistent game world. This phase implements WebSocket connections, real-time messaging, player presence tracking, and state synchronization - all essential prerequisites for Phase 3's gameplay systems. The infrastructure built here will support scaling from local development to millions of concurrent players while maintaining sub-50ms latency for critical game events.

## Product Vision

- **Presence Infrastructure** - Track and broadcast player online/offline status
- **State Synchronization Framework** - Efficient delta-based state updates
- **Event Distribution System** - Typed, versioned event routing and handling
- **Connection Management** - Automatic reconnection with state recovery

### What We're NOT Building
- Game-specific logic (combat, inventory, etc.) - Phase 3
- Chat message content handling - Phase 3
- Voice communication - Future phase
- Anti-cheat systems - Future phase
- Matchmaking algorithms - Future phase
