# 🌐 Phase 2: Real-time Networking - Overview

## 📋 Executive Summary

Phase 2 establishes the real-time networking foundation that transforms our authenticated users into connected players in a persistent game world. Building directly on Phase 1's authentication system, this phase implements WebSocket connections, real-time messaging, player presence tracking, and state synchronization - all essential prerequisites for Phase 3's gameplay systems.

### Technical Approach by Component

#### 1. WebSocket Infrastructure
- **Gateway Enhancement**: Upgrade HTTP to WebSocket with JWT validation
- **Protocol**: JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSocket for structured messaging
- **Connection Management**: Heartbeat/pong system with configurable timeouts
- **Message Types**: Typed event system with versioning support

#### 2. Real-time Messaging
- **Event Categories**: System, Player, World, Game, Chat (foundation for Phase 3)
- **Message Queue**: Client-side queue with priority and retry logic
- **Batching**: Automatic message batching for network efficiency
- **Compression**: Optional zlib compression for large payloads

#### 3. State Synchronization
- **State Types**: Player state, world state, session state
- **Update Strategy**: Delta updates with periodic full snapshots
- **Conflict Resolution**: Server-authoritative with client prediction
- **Caching**: Multi-level caching (client, gateway, service)

#### 4. Session Management
- **Player Sessions**: Track connected players with presence status
- **Reconnection**: Automatic reconnection with state recovery
- **Session Transfer**: Seamless handoff between gateway instances
- **Timeout Handling**: Configurable idle and disconnect timeouts

### Integration Points

- **With Phase 0**: Uses existing HTTP/WebSocket client infrastructure
- **With Phase 1**: Leverages JWT auth for WebSocket authentication
- **For Phase 3**: Provides messaging foundation for gameplay systems
- **Database**: Extends schema for session and state persistence
- **Cache**: Redis for real-time session data and state caching

### Performance Targets

- **Latency**: < 50ms for message delivery (same region)
- **Throughput**: 1000+ messages/second per connection
- **Connections**: 10,000+ concurrent per gateway instance
- **State Updates**: 60Hz for critical data, 10Hz for non-critical
