# ðŸŽ­ Phase 1.5: Character System Foundation - Requirements Specification

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive requirements specification for Phase 1.5 of the MMORPG Template project. Phase 1.5 implements a complete character management system that enables players to create, customize, select, and manage their in-game characters. This phase bridges the authentication system (Phase 1) and the real-time networking system (Phase 2), establishing the foundation for all character-based gameplay features.

## Business Requirements

### Strategic Objectives

**BR1.5.1**: Provide a production-ready character system that game developers can customize and extend for their specific MMORPG needs.

**BR1.5.2**: Enable players to create and manage multiple unique characters per account, supporting different playstyles and experiences.

**BR1.5.3**: Establish a scalable data architecture that can support millions of characters across distributed servers.

**BR1.5.4**: Create a monetization foundation through character slots and premium customization options.

**BR1.5.5**: Ensure the character system integrates seamlessly with existing authentication and future gameplay systems.

### Success Metrics

- **Adoption Rate**: 95% of authenticated users create at least one character
- **Retention**: 80% of users with characters return within 7 days
- **Performance**: Character operations complete in under 1 second
- **Scalability**: Support 100,000+ concurrent character operations
