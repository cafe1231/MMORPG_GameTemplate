## Phase 1.5 - Character System Foundation 🚧

### Overview
Phase 1.5 bridges the gap between authentication (Phase 1) and networking (Phase 2) by implementing a comprehensive character management system. This phase establishes the foundation for all character-based gameplay features.

### Backend Implementation (100% Complete) ✅

**Completed Components:**
- **Character Service**: Hexagonal architecture with clean separation ✅
- **Database Schema**: 6 migration files (004-009) for complete data model ✅
- **CRUD Operations**: Full create, read, update, delete with soft delete ✅
- **Redis Caching**: Individual and list caching with automatic invalidation ✅
- **NATS Events**: Real-time event publishing for character state changes ✅
- **JWT Middleware**: Authentication and authorization integration ✅
- **Unit Tests**: >90% coverage across all packages ✅
- **Integration Tests**: Repository and cache testing ✅

**Working Endpoints:**
- POST `/api/v1/characters` - Create new character
- GET `/api/v1/characters` - List user's characters
- GET `/api/v1/characters/{id}` - Get character details
- PUT `/api/v1/characters/{id}` - Update character
- DELETE `/api/v1/characters/{id}` - Soft delete character
- POST `/api/v1/characters/{id}/select` - Set active character

**Test Results:**
- Unit Test Coverage: 93.5% ✅
- All API endpoints tested and working ✅
- Database migrations applied successfully ✅
- Redis caching operational ✅
- NATS events publishing ✅
- JWT authentication integrated ✅

**Deferred Tasks:**
- Rate limiting (to be implemented at gateway level)
- Load testing (deferred to integration phase)
- Security audit (scheduled for final testing)
