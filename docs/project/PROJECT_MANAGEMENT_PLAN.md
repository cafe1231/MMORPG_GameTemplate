## Risk Management Framework

### Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk Category | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|--------------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| Technical Debt | High | Medium | Regular refactoring sprints |
| Scope Creep | Medium | High | Strict change control process |
| Key Person Dependency | Medium | High | Cross-training and documentation |
| Technology Changes | Low | High | Architecture abstraction layers |
| Performance Issues | Medium | Medium | Continuous performance testing |
| Security Vulnerabilities | Low | Critical | Security reviews each phase |

### Risk Response Plans

#### High Priority Risks

1. **Network Architecture Scalability**
   - **Response**: Prototype early in Phase 2A
   - **Trigger**: Load test shows < 100 concurrent users
   - **Action**: Architecture review and redesign

2. **Database Performance**
   - **Response**: Performance testing in Phase 1.5
   - **Trigger**: Query time > 100ms for common operations
   - **Action**: Query optimization or schema redesign

3. **Integration Complexity**
   - **Response**: Integration tests from Phase 2A
   - **Trigger**: Integration test failure rate > 20%
   - **Action**: Simplify interfaces or add abstraction layer

### Contingency Planning

**Schedule Contingencies**
- 10% buffer built into each phase
- Optional features identified for scope reduction
- Parallel work streams where possible

**Resource Contingencies**
- Approved contractor list for surge capacity
- Cross-training plan for all critical roles
- Documentation standards to enable handoffs
